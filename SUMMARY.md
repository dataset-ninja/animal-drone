**Animal Drone** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 686 images with 3065 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cattle*).

Each image in the Animal Drone dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 163 (24% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (1 images), *valid* (52 images), and *train* (633 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/).
